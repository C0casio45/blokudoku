## Why

I play a game developped [by EasyBrain](https://easybrain.com/) named blokudoku
I recently take the plane to Italy and make this app (4h of work)

# What's remains to do

## features

- Points when player make a square of 3x3
- Score streak
- Landing page
- Ends the game when the player cannot place block anymore
- Possibility for objects to rotate (not appear on the same position each time)

## bugs

- When to block are the same, sometimes the wrong one disapear
- Sometimes the block you just used disapear
- When you overflow the grid, previous lines deleted appear again
- Draggable object is doing weird things
